                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to my about page! My name is Sagar, and I'm a software development student who is passionate about web development and martial arts.

                    I've always been interested in technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. This interest led me to pursue a degree in software development, where I've learned various programming languages, software engineering principles, and best practices for developing robust and scalable applications.
                    
                    In particular, I'm passionate about web development and enjoy building websites and web applications. I find it exciting to create something that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection and can provide value to users. I enjoy working with front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, as well as back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails.
                    
                    Apart from my love for software development, I also have a real passion for martial arts. I find the discipline, focus, and physical training involved in martial arts to be an excellent complement to my technical work. I've been practicing martial arts for several years and have experience in a variety of styles, including Taekwondo, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
                    
                    Overall, I believe that both software development and martial arts require dedication, perseverance, and continuous learning. I'm excited to continue pursuing my passions and seeing where they take me in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my about page, and I look forward to connecting with you!
