                <h2>History of  Kickboxing</h2>
                <p>
                    Kickboxing has a rich and badass history that dates back to ancient times. In Japan, the sport was known as "muayai" and was used by samurai warriors to improve their striking skills. In Thailand, the sport evolved into "muay thai," a form of martial arts that incorporated brutal knee and elbow strikes. Kickboxing as we know it today originated in the 1960s in Japan when karate practitioners began experimenting with kicks and punches in full-contact matches. The sport quickly gained popularity and spread to other countries, with the first world championship held in Los Angeles in 1974. Since then, kickboxing has become a global phenomenon, with millions of practitioners and fans worldwide. Its intense and badass nature continues to attract those who seek a challenging and rewarding workout, as well as those who aspire to become champions in the ring
